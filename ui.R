I think this chart is especially useful because it could provide useful information to a potential film director on which movie rating to design/cater to based on the highest mean influx of money worldwide (based on the top 1000 domestically highest-performing movies recorded).

While all of the movie licenses make the same income on the scale of hundreds of millions (according to this dataset), rated R movies from this dataset perform the lowest in terms of mean worldwide sales.

G-rated and PG-13-rated films from this dataset averaged almost identically with PG-rated films from this dataset averaging slightly less at dollars."),
